# Enviro-Sensing-HAT 

This project is based on an environment stimulus sensor HAT, the HAT will have three sensors mounted, two digital sensor and one analog sensor. There is a Light digital sensor and a Temperature analog sensor, the third sensor is the back-up sensor.

The light sensor can be tested in numerous ways like shining a light on it or covering it. Temperature sensor can sensor the temperature of the surrounding area.
