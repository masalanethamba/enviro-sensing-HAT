# Enviro-Sensing-HAT 

The Environment Sensor HAT is designed for Raspberry Pi, with rich onboard resources including ambient light sensor, VOC sensor, IR / UV sensor, gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, barometer, temperature & humidity sensor, and so on. It uses the simple I2C bus for communicating with Raspberry Pi.

The Environment Sensor HAT gives Raspberry Pi the ability to collect environment data like temperature & humidity, air pressure, ambient light intensity, VOC, IR ray, UV ray, etc. It can also be used to build a robot that can detect motion and orientation.
