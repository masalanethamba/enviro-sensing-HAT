GROUP 34

Getting Started with Temperature Sensor version5.1 and STM32CubeID

Introduction
_________________________________________________________________________________

In this simple getting started how to document, we will be building a simple STM32CUBEID project (code) on a simple Temperature and Humidity Sensor uHAT. At its simplest/basic level the whole process of deploying  a code to the Temperature and Humidity Sensor PCB Version 5.1 consists of two “must do'' steps:

→ You would need to set your Temperature and Humidity Sensor with Group34OS, the  host OS which is responsible for  communication with the UCTCloud and also runs the core operations of the device

→  You need to also push your STM32CUBEID project image builder, which is responsible for pulling in all the important   
   dependencies and makes a container image for your fleet.
   
A completion of these steps implies that your Temperature and humidity Sensor Ver 5.1 will start to download the container image, begin your application, and start sending logs to your Group34 dashboard. This has got you at least a step towards success!


What will you need?
__________________________________________________________________________________

→ A Temperature and Humidity Sensor uHAT Ver5.1. You can also visit or GitHub   
  models.
  
→  18650-5V Li-ion battery for Power supply.

→ A simple micro USB cable for access to the CH340G transceiver and debugging

→ The micro USB can also be used for power supply.

→ A syringe for water drops to acknowledge the functionality of sensors.

→ The STM32F051 UCT discovery board for the Cortex-M0 microcontroller interfacing.
